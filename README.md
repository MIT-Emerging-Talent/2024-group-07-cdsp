# Migration Patterns in Post-Conflict Regions

## Overview
Our project focuses on understanding migration patterns within post-conflict regions. We aim to identify patterns in internal migration versus international migration within a post-conflict country, with a specific focus on understanding the dynamics of displacement.


## Milestone 1: Problem Identification
**Date: 22-26 January, 2024**

### Problem Statement
Our problem statement is rooted in personal experiences and the observation of migration challenges within post-conflict regions. Many individuals face significant barriers such as economic challenges, education barriers, unsafe environments due to war, and economic struggles in underdeveloped countries. These factors contribute to the complex issue of migration dynamics in post-conflict areas.

### Understanding of the Problem Domain
Applying systems thinking and design thinking, our group recognizes the multi-faceted nature of migration patterns. We understand that migration is influenced by various factors, including economic hardships, educational barriers, and the impact of war. This holistic understanding guides our exploration of migration patterns in post-conflict regions.

### Actionable Research Question
Building on our understanding of the problem domain, we formulate the following actionable research question:
**Research Question:** What are the discernible patterns in internal migration as opposed to international migration within a post-conflict country, considering the interplay of conflict data, socio-economic factors, and other relevant variables?

## Objective
This project focuses on identifying patterns in internal migration versus international migration within post-conflict countries, with an emphasis on understanding the dynamics of displacement.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- Migration data
- Conflict data
- Socio-economic factors

## Scope and Region
The study involves analyzing migration patterns within the post-conflict country, considering both internal and cross-border movements. Special attention is given to the youth demographic.

## Key Questions
1. What are the main push factors influencing migration in the post-conflict region?
2. What are the main pull factors attracting individuals to migrate within or outside the post-conflict country?

## Reasons for Migration
Various factors contribute to migration in the post-conflict region, including:
- Minority status
- Economic challenges
- Education barriers
- War
- Unsafe environment
- Economic struggles
- Underdeveloped country
- Economic hardships
- Basic needs

## Factors Influencing Immigrant Destination Choices

1. **Respect for Minorities:**
   Immigrants often consider destinations that prioritize the respectful treatment of minorities, seeking places where diversity is valued and discrimination is minimal.

2. **Promising Future Prospects:**
   The allure of a better future is a significant factor. Immigrants tend to choose destinations that offer opportunities for personal and professional growth, including education, career advancement, and economic stability.

3. **Citizenship Opportunities:**
   The prospect of obtaining citizenship is a key motivator. Countries with welcoming immigration policies and a clear path to citizenship attract individuals seeking a long-term commitment to their chosen destination.

4. **Geography and Culture:**
   The geographical and cultural aspects of a destination play a pivotal role. Immigrants often gravitate towards places with climates, landscapes, and cultural norms that align with their preferences and values.

5. **Financial Opportunities:**
   Economic considerations are crucial. Immigrants assess destinations based on the availability of financial opportunities, including employment options, business prospects, and overall economic well-being.

## Milestone 2: Data Collection
**Date: 29 January - 2 February, 2024**

### Non-Technical Explanation of Modeling Approach
To model our problem domain, we considered insights from domain experts, data availability, and the relevance of different features. Our approach involves leveraging various datasets that capture migration, conflict, and socio-economic factors. However, potential flaws may arise from biases in the selected datasets or limitations in representing the full complexity of migration dynamics.

### Documentation for Data Set
Our dataset includes migration data from sources such as UNICEF, Our World in Data, Migration Data Portal, Eurostat, World Bank, Kaggle, and academic studies. The data is structured to cover migration patterns, conflict data, and socio-economic factors. Possible flaws include potential biases in data collection methodologies and variations in reporting standards across different sources. we will put the detailed documentation after finazilizing our selected dataset.

### Data Collection and Cleaning Scripts
For transparency and replicability, all data collection and cleaning scripts are available in the our directory. that scripts cover the entire process, including the separation of data into training and validation sets, where applicable.

### Public Hosting of Prepared Data Set
Our team is actively in the process of analyzing and preparing the datasets obtained from various sources, including UNICEF, Our World in Data, Migration Data Portal, Eurostat, World Bank, Kaggle, and academic studies. We are meticulously working on cleaning, aggregating, and structuring the data to derive meaningful insights.

While the preparation of the dataset is underway, we anticipate completing this phase shortly. Once the analysis is complete, we will host the prepared dataset, making it accessible to the public for further exploration and replication of our findings.

Stay tuned for updates on the hosted dataset, which will be available soon.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work towards providing a comprehensive and well-documented dataset for the community.
