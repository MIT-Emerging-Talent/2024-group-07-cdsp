# Milestone 3: Data Analysis
**5-16 February, 2024**

## Non-Technical Explanation
In our analysis of selected countries over the five-year period (2014-2019), distinct migration patterns emerged from EuroStat's dataset. The data indicates that, in general, more men migrate than women. However, exceptions exist, such as in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Sudan, Mozambique, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Madagascar, where women's migration rates surpass those of men. This underscores significant gender variations in migration patterns and specific trends in certain countries.

A simple internet search reveals that gender disparities in migration are influenced by factors like a preference for societies with gender equality, economic opportunities, and sociocultural elements. Women often migrate independently for better work and education, contributing to a balanced gender representation in migration flows.

Education and empowerment are crucial drivers for female migration, as women seek growth in societies offering these opportunities. Government policies promoting gender equality also shape migration patterns. A comprehensive understanding requires exploring specific data points, recognizing the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors in migration dynamics.

Examining the migration data, patterns emerge, highlighting higher migration rates in specific years for certain countries. Further exploration into the reasons for this phenomenon provides valuable insights:

1. Afghanistan 2015: Increased migration due to persistent security concerns and ongoing conflicts.
2. Angola 2019: Escalating political instability and economic challenges fueled higher migration.
3. Bosnia and Herzegovina 2019: Rising migration linked to regional tensions and economic factors.
4. Burundi 2019: Heightened migration likely connected to political instability and social unrest.
5. Chechnya (part of the conflict in Russia): Ongoing regional conflicts identified as a primary driver of migration.
6. Colombia 2019: Migration surge influenced by a combination of political and economic challenges.
7. Democratic Republic of Congo 2019: Political instability and conflict prompting an increase in migration.
8. Eritrea 2015: Migration upsurge amid political repression and limited economic opportunities.
9. Ethiopia (various conflicts, including the Ethiopian Civil War) 2016: Escalating conflicts and civil unrest contributing to migration.
10. Iraq 2015: Increased migration due to conflicts, security concerns, and economic challenges.
11. Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) 2017: Economic factors and political stability influencing migration patterns.
12. Kosovo 2019: Migration rise linked to economic hardships and political tensions.
13. Lebanon 2016, 2017, 2018: Ongoing regional conflicts and economic instability driving migration.
14. Liberia 2017, 2018: Economic difficulties and recovery from past conflicts impacting migration.
15. Libya 2015: Escalating political instability and security concerns contributing to migration.
16. Mozambique 2019, 2014: Regional conflicts and economic challenges driving migration.
17. Myanmar 2017, 2018, 2019: Rohingya crisis and ethnic conflicts leading to increased migration.
18. Northern Ireland (The Troubles, though largely resolved by 2011): Lingering effects of past conflicts contributing to migration.
19. Sierra Leone 2017: Economic factors and recovery from past conflicts impacting migration.
20. Somalia 2014, 2015: Ongoing conflicts, political instability, and economic challenges fueling migration.
21. South Sudan 2019: Political instability, conflicts, and economic difficulties leading to migration.
22. Sri Lanka 2014, 2015: Post-war recovery and economic opportunities influencing migration.
23. Sudan 2015, 2016: Ongoing conflicts, economic challenges, and political instability driving migration.
24. Syria 2016: Escalating conflicts and humanitarian crisis contributing to migration.
25. Ukraine (conflict escalated in 2014) 2019: Ongoing conflict and political tensions leading to migration.
26. Yemen 2019: Prolonged conflicts and humanitarian crisis driving migration.

## Technical Overview

# Comprehensive Data Analysis Report

Our in-depth analysis harnessed EuroStat (ESTAT) and UN datasets, with a primary focus on the 2014-2019 period. The objective was to provide a comprehensive perspective, requiring the integration of GDP data from the World Bank. The meticulous selection of columns followed past recommendations, incorporating valuable insights from neighboring countries.

## Investigative Focus

The core of our investigation centered on unraveling migration patterns within post-conflict regions. Our primary goal was to identify key influencers driving migration, guiding individuals from their origin countries to new destinations. Initial exploration uncovered various migration datasets, but none precisely matched our specific focus on post-conflict scenarios.

## Dataset Discovery

After an exhaustive search, we identified a novel dataset, sharing its link on our GitHub repository. Spanning from 2014 to 2019, this dataset offered an extensive array of indicators and factors impacting migration. Due to time constraints, our analysis strategically honed in on pivotal factors crucial for predicting future migration patterns, distinct from other datasets.

## Data Cleaning and Anticipated Patterns

In the second phase of data cleaning, our attention shifted to factors contributing to our anticipated patterns. To address concerns arising from the temporal gap between 2019 and 2024, we directed our focus to countries embroiled in conflict from 2014 to 2019. This approach, while excluding certain nations, enabled us to predict migration patterns bridging both past and current conflicts.

## Introduction of GDP Variable

During the subsequent data analysis phase, we introduced a new variable – GDP. Exploring theories linking destination countries' perceptions of economic issues in origin countries to migration, our findings revealed an absence of a consistent correlation between GDP and the number of migrants from conflict-afflicted origin countries.

While some origin countries exhibited a correlation between GDP and migration, others did not. Recognizing the intricate nature of migration determinants, we delved into additional factors influencing migration in the non-technical section of our project.

## Analysis of Popular Destination Countries

Expanding our inquiry to popular destination countries (Sweden, Spain, Italy), a parallel correlation between the number of migrants and GDP emerged. However, similar to the origin countries, this correlation proved inconsistent across all destination countries. In conclusion, a definitive statement regarding whether the GDP of our origin or destination countries directly affects the number of migrants remains elusive.
