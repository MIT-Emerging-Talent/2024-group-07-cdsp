# Data Cleaning Report for Post-Conflict Migration Patterns Project

## Introduction
In this report, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of our data cleaning phase for the Post-Conflict Migration Patterns project. The report is structured to emphasize clarity for individuals unfamiliar with the topic.

## Background and Dataset Selection
Our project revolves around understanding migration patterns in post-conflict regions. To initiate this research, we extensively explored various datasets, seeking relevance and reliability. Our decision-making process involved consulting different research sources, ensuring a robust foundation for our study.

The chosen dataset, available at [Link to Dataset](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/8/9/139), emerged as the most suitable for our project due to its comprehensive coverage from 2014 to 2019 and its focus on post-conflict countries.

## Project Size Considerations
Given the complexity and scale of our project, we strategically narrowed our focus within the dataset. Our goal was to extract specific data related to post-conflict scenarios, ensuring the depth of our analysis without being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information.

## Dataset Management and GitHub Repository
To enhance transparency, we organized our main dataset and the cleaning dataset on our GitHub repository. This facilitates accessibility for all stakeholders, allowing them to delve into the data and understand the intricacies of our analysis. Our data cleaning process is already available inside the "Toky Linin" folder in our general group project repository. Interested individuals can access it by looking inside the "Data Cleaning" folder, which includes two steps: the first iteration and the second iteration. Each step is a crucial part of our process to limit and specialize our focus on specific factors and countries related to our main topic.

## Focus on Post-Conflict Countries and Key Indicators
Our project specifically concentrates on post-conflict countries, providing a nuanced perspective on migration patterns. To streamline our analysis, we honed in on key factors and indicators within the main dataset, ensuring precision and relevance in our findings.

## Challenges and Tailored Approach
The data collection process posed challenges, requiring a meticulous approach to align it with our research topic. The complexities of post-conflict scenarios demanded a tailored strategy. In response, we decided to focus on specific countries and factors, optimizing our efforts and time.

## Conclusion
This report encapsulates our meticulous approach to data cleaning, offering a clear understanding of our methodology. The structured organization ensures accessibility for all readers, even those less familiar with the topic.
