# Systems Thinking in Migration Project:

1. **Understanding Connections:**
   - Analyze how various factors like social norms, economic considerations, environmental conditions, and cultural influences contribute to migration patterns. Explore how these interconnected elements influence the decision-making processes of individuals and communities regarding migration.

2. **Finding Loops:**
   - Identify patterns where specific conditions in one region impact migration dynamics elsewhere. For instance, explore how changes in governmental policies or economic opportunities in one area might create cascading effects on migration trends.

3. **Setting Limits:**
   - Determine the scope of your study by understanding how migration is linked to broader aspects like societal structures and financial systems. Examine how alterations in one domain may lead to ripple effects across others, setting limits on the scope of your analysis.

4. **Mapping Systems:**
   - Visualize the intricate connections within migration systems. Create diagrams illustrating how socio-economic factors, legislative influences, and environmental conditions collectively shape migration dynamics. This mapping helps identify crucial points for intervention and improvement in migration-related initiatives.

# Design Thinking in Migration Project:

1. **Understanding People:**
   - Utilize personal experiences and data from open sources to comprehend the needs and challenges faced by various stakeholders in migration processes. Consider perspectives from government bodies, businesses, local communities, and individuals to inform the design process.

2. **Defining the Issue:**
   - Identify key problems in migration through comprehensive analysis and by listening to the concerns of different groups. Use personal experiences and data from open sources to pinpoint challenges and opportunities for enhancing migration outcomes.

3. **Generating Ideas:**
   - Brainstorm creative solutions to address challenges in migration. Test these ideas through simulations or small projects to evaluate their effectiveness and feasibility in real-world scenarios.

4. **Making Progress:**
   - Continuously iterate and improve on proposed solutions based on feedback from participants and factual observations. Ensure that the implemented solutions align with cultural norms, are user-friendly, and consider the perspectives of all stakeholders involved in the migration process.
